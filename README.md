# Done
    [X] The user should be able to input the size of the grid -> Done

    [X] The grid should be a square -> Done

    [X] The user should be able to click on a grid -> Done

    [X] The grid should be initialized with 3 ships at random cells in the grid

    [X] If a ship exists in the cell they clicked on, then the click is
        considered a hit. Else, it's a miss. This should be displayed as an alert to
        the user

    [X] Once the user gets all three ships, then the following statistics should
    be displayed:

     [X] Total number of tries it took the user to win the game

     [X] Accuracy of the user
